    <h1>Allama Muhammad Iqbal</h1>
    <h2>Poet of the East | Thinker | Philosopher</h2>



    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal was one of the greatest philosophers, poets, and thinkers of the Muslim world. He is known
        as the Poet of the East (Shair-e-Mashriq). His poetry awakened the Muslims of the subcontinent and gave them a
        vision of self-respect, freedom, and unity.
    </p>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>


    <p>Allama Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in Sialkot, British India (now Pakistan). He received his early
        education in Sialkot and later studied in Lahore, England, and Germany. He earned a doctorate in philosophy and
        became a well-known scholar.</p>

    <h3>Poetry and Philosophy</h3>

    <P>Iqbal’s poetry focuses on self-realization (Khudi), faith, courage, and action. He wrote poetry in Urdu and
        Persian. His famous books include:</P>

    <ol>
        <li>Bang-e-Dra</li>
        <li>Bal-e-Jibril</li>
        <li>Asrar-e-Khudi</li>
        <li>Zarb-e-Kalim</li>
    </ol>


    <p>His work encouraged Muslims to rise, think independently, and shape their own destiny.</p>


    <h3>Role in the Creation of Pakistan</h3>

    <p>Allama Iqbal is considered the ideological founder of Pakistan. In his 1930 Allahabad Address, he presented the
        idea of a separate homeland for Muslims of the subcontinent. His vision later became a reality under the
        leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinna</p>

    <blockquote>“Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle,
        Khuda bande se khud poochay bata teri raza kya hai.”</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“Nations are born in the hearts of poets; they prosper and die in the hands of politicians.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>“Failure is not fatal until we surrender.”</blockquote>

    <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>

    <p>Allama Iqbal passed away on 21 April 1938, but his thoughts and poetry continue to inspire millions around the
        world. He is remembered as a leader who awakened the Muslim Ummah and shaped the ideology of Pakistan.</p>
