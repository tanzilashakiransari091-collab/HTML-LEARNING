    <h1>🌟 Poem: “Rise and Shine”</h1>
<div class="container">
    <P>In the heart of dreams, a spark does glow,<br>
        Through winding paths, we learn and grow.<br>
        With every fall, we rise once more,<br>
        Unlocking strength we had before.<br></P>

    <p>Challenges come, yet we won’t sway,<br>
        Each small step lights a brighter way.<br>
        Through code and canvas, words and art,<br>
        We chase the vision within our heart.<br></p>

    <p>So take a breath, and start today,<br>
        Let passion guide you on your way.<br>
        For every effort, big or small,<br>
        Is a building block toward standing tall.<br></p>
